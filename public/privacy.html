      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Pix GPT MCP (the “Service”) handles information. The Service
        generates Pix “copy and paste” payloads and QR codes from inputs provided by the user inside ChatGPT.
      </p>

      <h2>Operator</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is operated by <strong>Gustavo de Oliveira Soares Silva</strong> (trading as
        <strong>11 Feed</strong>). Contact: <strong>support@11feed.com</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>No Data Acquisition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not acquire personal data.</strong> We do not collect, store, sell, or rent user data.</li>
        <li><strong>No analytics / ads.</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, ad networks, pixels, or similar tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>No banking data.</strong> We never ask for or store bank credentials. We do not process payments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information Processed to Generate a Pix Code</h2>
      <p>
        To generate a Pix payload, the Service may receive values such as Pix key, recipient name, city, optional
        reference, and optional amount. These values are used only to format the Pix payload and render the QR
        image for you to pay in your bank of choice.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Tip: do not submit sensitive personal information beyond what is necessary for the payment (e.g., avoid IDs).
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        The Service does not set cookies.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Providers (Hosting / DNS)</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run). DNS is provided by Hostinger. These providers may
        process limited technical request data as required to deliver the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable precautions to protect the Service. However, no internet transmission is fully secure.
      </p>

      <h2>BACEN Reference and Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        QR codes are generated based on the Banco Central do Brasil (BACEN) BR Code specification (e.g., BR Code 2.0.1).
        This is a <strong>static</strong> QR generation service: there is no integration with the PIX system or banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before paying via QR code, verify that the recipient and amount shown by your banking app are correct. We are
        not responsible for the accuracy and integrity of user-provided information or payments made from incorrect data.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Implementation note: the Service uses open-source libraries to format the BR Code payload and render QR images.
      </p>

      <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may include links to third-party websites or resources. We are not responsible for their content,
        information, services, products, or privacy practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We may comply with legal obligations and valid legal processes. Because we do not collect or store user data,
        our ability to provide user-specific records is limited.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes take effect when posted on this page.
