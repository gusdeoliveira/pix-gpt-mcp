      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Pix GPT MCP. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Operator</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is operated by <strong>Gustavo de Oliveira Soares Silva</strong> (trading as
        <strong>11 Feed</strong>). Contact: <strong>support@11feed.com</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Service Description</h2>
      <p>
        Pix GPT MCP generates Pix “copy and paste” codes and QR codes from user-provided inputs inside ChatGPT.
        The Service does not execute transfers, does not process payments, does not hold funds, and does not
        integrate with the PIX system or banks.
      </p>

      <h2>BACEN Reference</h2>
      <p>
        QR codes are generated based on the Banco Central do Brasil (BACEN) BR Code specification
        (e.g., BR Code 2.0.1). The Service only formats data into a static Pix payload and renders it as a QR code.
      </p>

      <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for providing accurate and lawful information.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for verifying the Pix recipient and amount in your banking app before paying.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fraud and Misuse</h2>
      <p>
        Any attempt at fraud, impersonation, identity falsification, or use of the Service for illegal purposes is a
        material breach of these Terms and may result in immediate suspension of access and other measures as permitted
        by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Prohibited Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fraud, impersonation, or any illegal activity.</li>
        <li>Interfering with, disrupting, or attempting to bypass security features of the Service.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineering or attempting to extract source code beyond what is permitted by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not warrant that the generated information is
        error-free. Before transferring using a QR code, verify that all information is correct in your banking app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is a static QR generator without any integration with PIX or banks. We disclaim any responsibility
        for the accuracy and integrity of user-provided information and for any payments made using incorrect data.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        or exemplary damages arising from your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We do not acquire personal data and do not use tracking. Please review the Privacy Policy for details.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes take effect when posted on this page. Continued use of the
        Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of Brazil. Any disputes will be handled in the courts of São Paulo, Brazil.
